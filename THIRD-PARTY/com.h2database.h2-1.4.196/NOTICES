 * This code is based on the LZF algorithm from Marc Lehmann. It is a
 * re-implementation of the C code:

 * According to a mail from Marc Lehmann, it's OK to use his algorithm:

 * Subject: Re: Question about LZF licensing
 * ...
 * The algorithm is not copyrighted (and cannot be copyrighted afaik) - as long
 * as you wrote everything yourself, without copying my code, that's just fine
 * (looking is of course fine too).
 * ...
 *
 * Still I would like to keep his copyright info:

 * Chris,
 * The combinatorics algorithms in my textbook are all not under patent
 * or copyright. They are as much in the public domain as the solution to any
 * common question in an undergraduate mathematics course, e.g., in my
 * combinatorics course, the solution to the problem of how many arrangements
 * there are of the letters in the word MATHEMATICS. I appreciate your due
 * diligence.
